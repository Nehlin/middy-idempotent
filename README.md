## üõµ What is does

[Middy](https://middy.js.org/) is a very simple middleware engine that allows you to simplify your AWS Lambda code when using Node.js. This middleware aims to simplify the implementations of a idempotent API.

Make an API idempotent is not [trivial as much people think](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/develop/utilities/idempotency/), you could take a look at _Lambda Powertools for Python_ from AWS that does a great job to explain this use case and a concrete way to implement. There's also this great article from [Malcolm Featonby](https://twitter.com/mfeatonby), [Making retries safe with idempotent APIs](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/) featured in the Amazon Builder's Library as [Architecture level 300](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/category/learning-levels/advanced-300/) which falls ins the _advanced_ classification.

## üöÄ Install

Use your favorite package manager:

```bash
yarn add middy-idempotent
```

```bash
npm install middy-idempotent -S
```

## Usage

Besides `@middy/core`, you must also use `@middy/http-json-body-parser` since this middleware will read the request body and needed parsed as json. And right now I only tested twith the client provided by the `ioredis` lib as well, so you'll need to install it too. At tthe bottom there's a write-up where we'll find how to use a Serverless Database service called [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) for free that is currently (`0.0.13`) the only storage supported.

```ts
handler.use(jsonBodyParser()).use(
  idempotent({
    client: new Redis(process.env.UPSTASH_REDISS),
  })
);
```

Just place in your code, as soon as possible, passing the Redis client constructor with your `rediss://` url. See `demo` for an example of application with infrastructure provisioned in AWS CDK.

### TODO
- [] Add more storages (DynamoDB, etc)
- [] Choose what be the key (JSON path, header key etc)
